# NAS-Project
I joined the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) program so that I could explore my passion for technology and build a career out of it. During the class I decided I to utlizie what I learned to Create a NAS for my house. So I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and two flash drives, to use in combination with an older external drive I had.

# NAS-Project
I joined the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) program so that I could explore my passion for technology and build a career out of it. During the class I decided to utilize what I learned to create a Network Attached Storage (NAS). So I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and two 128 flash drives, to use in combination with a 1.5tb external drive I had. I set up the two flash drives set up in a RAID 1 configuration as a SMB file share and currently use it to store classwork and my resume. The 1.5tb external drive is also an SMB file share with ebooks, pictures, and everything else that could be useful to share access to with my devices.

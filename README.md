# NAS-Project
I joined the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) program so that I could explore my passion for technology and build a career out of it. During the class I decided I to utlizie what I learned to create a Network Attached Storage (NAS). So I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and two 128 flash drives, to use in combination with a 1.5tb external drive I had. I set up the two flash drives set up in a RAID 1 configuration as a SMB file share and currently use it to store classwork and my resume. The external drive is also an SMB file share with ebooks, videos, pictures, and anything else I want to share access to with my desktop and laptop at all times.
